# Time Tokens

Time Tokens is a tokens plugin for Spigot/Paper Minecraft servers. It allows players to gather tokens by spending time on the server which can be spent in token shops for some rare and unique rewards that server owners can create using built in features of the plugin. It can also serv as a time measuring plugin since it keeps track of how much players have spent on the server.
