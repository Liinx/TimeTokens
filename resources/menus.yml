#Here you can create your custom GUIs that can be used to make a token shop.
#This plugin has ability to create multiple menus each able to consist of multiple pages(inventories) that contain buttons(Items).
#Few things to note menu and page names have to be unique meaning you cant have 2 menus with same name or 2 pages
#with same name, and button IDs(slots) also have to be unique.

#There are currently three types(on-click) of buttons that you can use:
#command-performer - Allows you to set price and command that will be preformed when a player clicks on the button
#(assuming that he has the specified amount of tokens).
#page-opener - Opens a different page from the menus when the player click on the button.
#decoration - This button types have no usable features they are simply used decorate the GUI and make it look nicer.
